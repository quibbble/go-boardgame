# Go-boardgame

Go-boardgame is a simple [Go](https://golang.org) package that can be used as the scaffolding to write the game logic for any board or turn based game.

## Future Plans

Additional resources common to many games such as decks, hands, boards, etc. will be added as time goes on to make writing the logic for these games a far faster process. Any ideas or PRs to improve or add additional features are welcome.

## Implementations

Below are some examples of projects that currently make use of this package and can be used as a point of reference:

- [Carcassonne](https://github.com/quibbble/go-carcassonne)
- [Codenames](https://github.com/quibbble/go-codenames)
- [Connect4](https://github.com/quibbble/go-connect4)
- [Tsuro](https://github.com/quibbble/go-tsuro)
